# Nebulai Miner

An asynchronous Python script to run matrix computation tasks from the Nebulai Network platform.

---

## Description

This program fetches computation tasks from the Nebulai server, performs large matrix calculations in parallel, then submits the results back. It is suitable to run on a VPS with multiple tokens.

---

## Features

- Asynchronous using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for efficient I/O  
- Matrix processing with `numpy` and multithreading  
- Supports multiple tokens running in parallel  
- Can run as a systemd service for automatic start on VPS boot

---

## Installation

Make sure Python 3 and `pip` are installed. Then run:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/borckesd/nebulai-miner.git
   cd nebulai-miner
   ```

2. Create and fill the `token.txt` file with your token (example with one token):

   ```
ðŸ”‘ How to Get Your Token (Using Browser Developer Tools)
Visit https://nebulai.network/opencompute and log in.

Open your browser's Developer Tools:

Chrome/Edge: press Ctrl + Shift + I or F12

Firefox: press Ctrl + Shift + I

Go to the Network tab.

Refresh the page (F5).

Find and click on a network request with "task" in its name (e.g., finish/task).

Go to the Headers tab.

Scroll down in Request Headers until you find a line like:

token: your_token_here
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

### Run manually

```bash
python3 nebulai_miner.py
```

### Run as a systemd service (recommended)

1. Create the service file:

   `/etc/systemd/system/nebulai-miner.service`

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Nebulai Miner Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=ubuntu
   WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/nebulai-miner
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 -u nebulai_miner.py
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5
   StandardOutput=journal
   StandardError=journal

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

2. Reload systemd and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable nebulai-miner.service
   sudo systemctl start nebulai-miner.service
   ```

3. Check service status:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status nebulai-miner.service
   ```

## How to View Logs

To view the live output and logs from the running service:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u nebulai-miner.service -f
```

This command shows real-time logs (follow) from the `nebulai-miner` service.

---

## How to Stop and Manage the Service

- Stop the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop nebulai-miner.service
```

- Restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nebulai-miner.service
```

- Disable auto-start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nebulai-miner.service
```

- Enable auto-start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nebulai-miner.service
```

## Important Notes

- The `token.txt` file **is not uploaded to GitHub** because it contains your secret tokens.  
- Make sure your token(s) are correctly set so the mining process runs properly.  
- Use a Python Virtual Environment (`venv`) for better dependency isolation if desired.
